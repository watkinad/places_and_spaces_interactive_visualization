Abstract: 

Mapping the New Politics of Care displayed the effects of COVID-19 in the United States layering a wide range of social, economic, and environmental conditions on two interactive maps utilizing multiple vulnerability indexes. 

The first map, titled Community Health Workers, asked viewers to imagine what would happen if one million community workers were allocated across the USA by comparing four indexes of vulnerability alongside COVID-19 data. A user can toggle between multiple vulnerabilities for the distribution of the workers, specific to each county. Making decisions like this responsibly requires confronting and addressing not just the virus but also the inequalities and vulnerabilities that propelled the pandemic.

All people in the USA were granted the right to have access to free, safe, and effective COVID-19 vaccines over multiple federal distribution phases. But due to the limited doses available, the majority of states followed the Center for Disease Control’s recommendations to prioritize health-care personnel and long-term care facility residents in receiving the first vaccines. 

The second map titled, Vaccine Allocation, focused on this first distribution, Phase 1A of the federal program and compared how each state could have distributed 22 million doses of vaccine more equitably. Users can compare Phase 1A allocation vs allocation to vulnerable populations county by county, in each state. Prioritizing vulnerability could have mitigated health inequities and protected communities that were more likely to have the first and most concentrated COVID-19 outbreaks.

The vulnerabilities made visible in both maps predated the pandemic and created the conditions for the virus to flourish. Both maps display the acute inequalities embedded in the social and political landscape of the USA. This pandemic is not simply biological. It is a symptom of an illness in our body politic. As COVID-19 roared across the country, it followed the fault lines of social vulnerability.","Gonsalves, Gregg, and Amy Kapczynski. 2020. “The New Politics of Care.” Boston Review, April 26, 2020. http://bostonreview.net/politics/gregg-gonsalves-amy-kapczynski-new-politics-care.

Abstract:  

""Spain lives in flats"" is an innovative and interactive journalistic project by elDiario.es that analyzes the footprint of more than 12 million buildings to map the height of Spanish cities in 3D to analyze their sustainability and impact on the current urban society. The investigation that includes narrative visualizations shows why Spain is one of the countries in the world that has built the highest and most dense cities compared to other countries. Two of every three Spaniards live in flats and apartments and only a third in single-family and semi-detached houses.

We created an R script that downloaded cadastral data and footprints of more than 12 million buildings. The total size of the downloaded files exceeded 200GB.

Then, we processed and joined in R all downloaded files to have a single database with the details of all the buildings in Spain. For example, we verified the data of 12 million buildings, we calculated the height of every building from the part that occupies the most built volume in the plans and we extracted the date of the building from the start of construction. All these processes were repeated several times during the year due to the publication of corrections and allowed us for the first time in Spain to have a database and a map with the heights of all the buildings in the country. This project compiled for the first time in a single database the cartographic plans of all the buildings currently standing in the Spanish territory and proved that in Spain we live in tall buildings.

When considering the structure of the story, we conceived it as a journey from the small anecdote to the big phenomenon. For this reason, the piece begins by telling the story of a building in A Coruña and then explaining vertical urbanism in Spain. This story works as a historical journey through each urban model developed in Spain contextualized with graphics and details of each moment.
 
We used R, Rstudio, QGIS and Tippecanoe for data compilation, processing and analysis. We had to do a lot of tests to compress the geographic information as much as possible to be able to map it on all devices. D3.js and Javascript were used for data visualization.

Abstract: 

We propose a general toolbox for the Now.museum - a ""digital space"" dedicated to individual and collective memories of significant events in our societies - whose context is informed by the collection and conservation of artifacts publicly available on the web. 
Clearly, Covid-19 and its global spreading belong to these significant events and could be documented by sharing digital collections across specific societal sectors, scientific domains, etc. However, a question is “how to capture its double spreading dimensionality spatially and in time”? Even if several retrospective initiatives exist, an integrative data curation approach and interface on information and testimonies is still missing. Moreover, relatively little attention was given to the ‘voices’ of the public, their testimonies, experiences, losses, and aspirations. 
Following the Open Science principle for science democratization, our macroscope – with its timeline interface -  answers these concerns with open data which provides context to individual experiences. Its infrastructural backbone consists in an open source archival platform (Dataverse) nourished from the capture of public parts of newspaper and social media, published in all Europe and in all languages since December 2019, including the term “Covid” in their title. 
The interface is designed as a searchable timeline, where captures are displayed as thumbnails, and sources as well as topics are color coded. The captures are indexed using AI techniques and links are provided to the original contents. The interactive interface is accompanied by a number of static overview maps, tracing bursts and changes in terminology, paying attention to geographic spread and multilinguality. 
The general design of the Now.museum as a space of cultural heritage, is applicable for any memory-collecting and sharing activity among the wider public, hence individual contributions are expected. To this end, a workflow is designed and a first implementation of ‘citizen/crowd material’ is given.

PS: Domain names Now.museum and Covid-19.museum are the ownership of Yves Rozenholc since the beginning of April 2020. Their denominations have been validated by the ICOM (International Council of Museums) which controls the extension museum.","A github repository  https://github.com/C19M/Covid-19.Museum describes the case, and contains links to the software code used. The timeline in essence runs on a Dataverse instance.

Measuring human development helps us understand how people’s lives and livelihoods vary across the world and how they have changed over time. 

There are several prominent measures that try to capture these changes: 

* The Human Development Index (HDI) 
* The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) 
* The Gender Development Index (GDI) 
* The Augmented Human Development Index (AHDI) 

The first three are published by the United Nations Development Programme. The AHDI, meanwhile, was developed by the economic historian Leandro Prados de la Escosura. 

All these measures seek to broaden the scope of development beyond simple economic growth and to capture other key metrics that track peoples’ living standards. 

However, measuring human development comes with many challenges. People do not always agree on what should be included. And even once defined, features of human development are difficult to measure. So how do these indices track human development? And what can we learn from them? We summarize the similarities and differences between the different approaches in this article and how to decide on which one to use.

Can we estimate how much the world has changed in a decade? Or do our own experiences impact the perception of progress? The work, titled The Shape of Change, challenges our assumptions about how key statistical indicators regarding Health, the Environment, or Education evolve through the years. The work was done in the context of the World Data Visualization Prize, part of the World Government Summit 2023. For that year, the competition focused on the past, present, and future of society and governments. The goal was to create a tool to showcase how data visualization can show data on innovations, decisions, and metrics that can be used to drive and measure progress. The organization made available three datasets, from which participants should create the visualizations. The dataset used in this work contained yearly observations for statistical indicators between 2012 and 2022. The work is a scrolly-telling piece that starts by taking the reader through significant news stories of the past decade. The goal is to connect the reader to the indicators by remembering specific events. Then, they are prompted to guess how an indicator related to the event changed, challenging the perception of the immediacy of news stories with the continuous change during the decade. Additionally, it has been shown \[1] that users prompted to reflect on their prior knowledge by predicting and self-explaining improve their recall and comprehension of the data. These exercises also serve to introduce the user to the visual element used to represent change: the angle, direction, and color of the triangles. This knowledge is then needed to interpret the small multiples visualization at the end of the piece, where the reader can have a bird's-eye view of the yearly change for all the indicators.

Abstract: 

The Social Determinants of Health Visualization Tool is an R Shiny application that provides a user-friendly platform for public health researchers, policy makers and the public to examine spatial-temporal patterns of and relationships between social determinants of health (SDOH) measures known to influence health outcomes at multi-scales in the U.S.

This visualization tool uses the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) SDOH beta database, which was curated from multiple Federal and publicly available data sources. Measures in the AHRQ SDOH database correspond to five key SDOH domains: social context (e.g., age, race/ethnicity), economic context (e.g., income, poverty), education, physical infrastructure (e.g., crime, environment), and healthcare context (e.g., health access, quality, behaviors). SDOH measures were collected for multiple years at two geographic levels in the U.S., i.e., county (324 variables, from 2009 to 2018), ZCTA (159 variables, from 2011 to 2018).

Using maps created by the Mapbox GL JavaScript library, and associated scatterplots, summary tables, and graphs created by R Shiny, this tool can display a wide range of SDOH measures at scale. There are three key elements of the tool: 

•        The Interactive Map tab renders county and ZCTA-level maps with options to select year and search for specific SDOH measure sorted by SDOH domain and topic. The zoom-in function allows for quick examination of SDOH in individual state and county.

•        The Change Analysis tab provides side by side synchronized maps, a scatterplot with Pearson correlation test, a multi-group histogram and a summary table, allowing users to investigate temporal changes of a SDOH measure.

•        The Pattern Comparisons tab further enables users to identify spatial associations and statistical relationships between different SDOH measures. 

With these features, this visualization tool can be used to obtain critical insights into the spatial-temporal patterns in and associations between SDOH measures, thereby informing public health research and practice.",<https://www.ahrq.gov/sdoh/data-analytics/sdoh-data.html>,peter-herman/readme; chang-zhao/readme

Charles Joseph Minard,"Charles J. Minard (1781–1870) was a French civil engineer who liked to study streams and physics. In the course of his long career as an engineer, he took part in many prominent public works and the restoration of European canals, bridges, and roads after the Napoleonic Wars. Before his retirement, he published treatises on construction, including unique memoirs on partial routes, distances, traveling, and expenses. When he was nearly 65 years old, he began to publish cartes figuratives (figurative maps). Most of his early maps focused on the flow of goods and passengers along railroad, river, and sea routes of commerce. He used innovative techniques, such as pie charts, flow maps, and choropleth maps, to substitute mathematically proportioned images for dry and complicated columns of statistical data; as a result, a panoptic view became possible at first glance, and unprecedented comparisons could be made. By the early 1860s, at nearly 80 years of age, his interests shifted from economic phenomena to historical subjects, such as the movements of famous armies. In the last year of his life, he created the Carte figurative des pertes successives en hommes de l’Armée Française dans la campagne de Russie 1812–1813, also known as Napoleon’s March to Moscow.",Minard,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cns-iu/scimaps/gh-pages/assets/content/person/charles-joseph-minard/image.jpg,,,,['maker'],,,,,,,,,,

This project explores the relationship between the capitalist system and its implications for climate change. Rooted in a critical examination of the capitalist pursuit of profit, perpetual consumption patterns, and the resulting inequality between citizens of “developed” and “developing” economies, it highlights the profound impact of these factors on the escalating climate crisis. Driven by H.A Baer’s work which emphasizes the role of capitalist ideology in perpetuating reliance on fossil fuels and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions \[1], we leverage data from the World Bank on greenhouse gas emissions per capita \[2], and the Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index (CRI) \[3]. The CRI is a weighted index of 4 measures used to evaluate the losses a country has experienced from extreme weather events connected to climate change. The losses analyzed are economic losses (absolute losses of purchasing power parity, and losses per GDP unit), and loss of life (number of lives lost, and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants). 

The visualization was created in processing using particle systems and a physics library to simulate realistic hurricane behavior. Particles leave short trails and have a centrifugal motion: rotating closer to the center than in the outer rim. The hurricanes have different eye sizes, total sizes, and speeds based on data values. For very at-risk countries, you would see a large hurricane with a small eye rotating quickly. The particles extinguish when they reach the eye of the hurricane and are then reseeded in the periphery. Ultimately, we aim to visually represent climate vulnerabilities juxtaposed with global greenhouse gas emissions to shed light on the relationship between risk and emissions at the country-level granularity. We emphasize that for high emitting nations, while pollution has historical been something to bury or ship away, climate risk cannot be exported.

Macroscope Link: <https://genetic-flow.com/>

GeneticFlow, our Macroscope, is intricately designed for the academic user groups at large, e.g., researchers, educators, decision-makers, or even fresh students in universities and research institutions. The tool meets an important need of academic researchers on the in-depth analysis and interpretation of scholars' impact, streamlining tasks such as scientific career analysis, academic award selection, and tenure evaluation. For junior students, it also opens a door for visually understanding the career path and biography of prestigious scientists, e.g., Turing award winners and Nobel prize laureates. Now we focus on several areas inside the computer science discipline, including AI, database, graphics, visualization, etc., but we may extend the coverage to more disciplines in near future (e.g., physics, material). 

The GeneticFlow tool mainly utilizes the comprehensive dataset provided by Microsoft Academic Graph, which encompasses an almost full coverage of academic data including papers, authors, citations, and topics, till 2021.10. At its core, the GeneticFlow tool designed a self-citation graph to visualize the evolution of a scholar’s research innovations, as well as their external impact. Cutting edge algorithms, including advisor-advisee detection, extend-type citation classification, embedding-based topic generation, and graph neural networks are employed in our tool for both effective visualization and downstream inference tasks. More details can be found in our KDD 2023, VIS 2023, and NeuroIPS 2023 papers. 

The visualization design employs a time-dependent hierarchical graph representation, further augmented with appropriate color mapping, interactive trend charts, and a topical map view, providing multidimensional insights into temporal and thematic aspects of a scholar's research contribution and impact. Through extensive case studies and quantitative evaluations, we find that the GeneticFlow visualization can highlight the key success of top-ranked scholars. It also predicts high-level award recipients (e.g., ACM fellows), with significantly better performance than classical impact indicators such as h-index, i-10 index, and citation networks.

Claudius Ptolemy,"Claudius Ptolemy (circa AD 90–168) was a profoundly influential astronomer, astrologer, geographer, and mathematician. Also known as Claudius Ptolemaeus, Ptolomaeus, Klaudios Ptolemaios, and Ptolemeus, he lived and worked in Alexandria, Egypt. His curiosity about the dynamic relationships between celestial bodies and the causes and effects of climate led him to invent a longitude and latitude grid system to construct maps of the world. His mathematical proofs stating that the Earth is a sphere are still accepted today, in spite of the fact that he placed this sphere as a fixed point in the center of a universe that revolved around it daily. Ptolemy synthesized and extended Hipparchus’s system of epicycles and circles to develop a geocentric theory of the solar system. His theory required more than 80 epicycles to explain the motions of the sun, the moon, and the five planets known in his time. It is described in Mathematical Syntaxis—widely called the Almagest—a 13-book mathematical treatment of the phenomena of astronomy, providing a means of calculating positions. The Almagest included a star catalog of 48 constellations, listing the names we still use today. Ptolemy also made major contributions to the history of geography and cartography. Ptolemy’s is the first known projection of the sphere onto a plane.

For Zeller, drawing, like travel, is a fluid action, a continuous response to itself, an endless effort to be present where the mark is being made. It is also a discipline in which past experience and study inform the mark, guiding it in ways that can become increasingly predictable. It thus becomes imperative to combine learned patterns into something else, to alter the predictable and discover that which is different yet somehow familiar. It is exploration, an active desire to find what is uncharted or hidden. On a geographic level, people still engage in this activity as individuals. But collectively they have reached a certain level of saturation—most of the frontiers have met one another and disappeared. Maps and charts show people where to explore and how to get to places that others have already seen.Zeller was awarded a Pollock-Krasner Foundation grant in 2001.

Abstract: 

Mapping the New Politics of Care displayed the effects of COVID-19 in the United States layering a wide range of social, economic, and environmental conditions on two interactive maps utilizing multiple vulnerability indexes. 

The first map, titled Community Health Workers, asked viewers to imagine what would happen if one million community workers were allocated across the USA by comparing four indexes of vulnerability alongside COVID-19 data. A user can toggle between multiple vulnerabilities for the distribution of the workers, specific to each county. Making decisions like this responsibly requires confronting and addressing not just the virus but also the inequalities and vulnerabilities that propelled the pandemic.

All people in the USA were granted the right to have access to free, safe, and effective COVID-19 vaccines over multiple federal distribution phases. But due to the limited doses available, the majority of states followed the Center for Disease Control’s recommendations to prioritize health-care personnel and long-term care facility residents in receiving the first vaccines. 

The second map titled, Vaccine Allocation, focused on this first distribution, Phase 1A of the federal program and compared how each state could have distributed 22 million doses of vaccine more equitably. Users can compare Phase 1A allocation vs allocation to vulnerable populations county by county, in each state. Prioritizing vulnerability could have mitigated health inequities and protected communities that were more likely to have the first and most concentrated COVID-19 outbreaks.

The vulnerabilities made visible in both maps predated the pandemic and created the conditions for the virus to flourish. Both maps display the acute inequalities embedded in the social and political landscape of the USA. This pandemic is not simply biological. It is a symptom of an illness in our body politic. As COVID-19 roared across the country, it followed the fault lines of social vulnerability.","Gonsalves, Gregg, and Amy Kapczynski. 2020. “The New Politics of Care.” Boston Review, April 26, 2020. http://bostonreview.net/politics/gregg-gonsalves-amy-kapczynski-new-politics-care.

Abstract: 

Economic inequality isn't just limited to neighborhoods. The restaurants, stores, and other places we visit in cities are all unequal in their own way.

The Atlas of Inequality shows the income inequality of people who visit different places in cities around the U.S. It uses aggregated anonymous location data from digital devices to estimate people's incomes and where they spend their time.

Using that data, we've made our own place inequality metric to capture how unequal the incomes of visitors to each place are. Economic inequality isn't just limited to neighborhoods, it's part of the places you visit every day.",<https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24899-8>,esteban-moro/readme

Macroscope Link: <https://genetic-flow.com/>

GeneticFlow, our Macroscope, is intricately designed for the academic user groups at large, e.g., researchers, educators, decision-makers, or even fresh students in universities and research institutions. The tool meets an important need of academic researchers on the in-depth analysis and interpretation of scholars' impact, streamlining tasks such as scientific career analysis, academic award selection, and tenure evaluation. For junior students, it also opens a door for visually understanding the career path and biography of prestigious scientists, e.g., Turing award winners and Nobel prize laureates. Now we focus on several areas inside the computer science discipline, including AI, database, graphics, visualization, etc., but we may extend the coverage to more disciplines in near future (e.g., physics, material). 

The GeneticFlow tool mainly utilizes the comprehensive dataset provided by Microsoft Academic Graph, which encompasses an almost full coverage of academic data including papers, authors, citations, and topics, till 2021.10. At its core, the GeneticFlow tool designed a self-citation graph to visualize the evolution of a scholar’s research innovations, as well as their external impact. Cutting edge algorithms, including advisor-advisee detection, extend-type citation classification, embedding-based topic generation, and graph neural networks are employed in our tool for both effective visualization and downstream inference tasks. More details can be found in our KDD 2023, VIS 2023, and NeuroIPS 2023 papers. 

The visualization design employs a time-dependent hierarchical graph representation, further augmented with appropriate color mapping, interactive trend charts, and a topical map view, providing multidimensional insights into temporal and thematic aspects of a scholar's research contribution and impact. Through extensive case studies and quantitative evaluations, we find that the GeneticFlow visualization can highlight the key success of top-ranked scholars. It also predicts high-level award recipients (e.g., ACM fellows), with significantly better performance than classical impact indicators such as h-index, i-10 index, and citation networks.

Francis Narin,"Francis Narin earned a BS in chemistry from Franklin & Marshall College, an MS in nuclear engineering from North Carolina State College, and a PhD in bibliometrics from Walden University. From 1963 to 1968, he worked at the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) Research Institute, where he was senior scientist and manager of the Techno-Social Research Center. During this time, he was principal investigator on the groundbreaking Technology in Retrospect and Critical Events in Science (TRACES) study, through which he developed many of the science and technology evaluation tools used today. In 1968, he founded CHI Research in Chicago. CHI’s first contract was to complete the TRACES study—one of the first attempts to quantify the research and development process by tracing and timing important events through the stages of non-mission research, mission-oriented research, and development and application. Starting in 1970, CHI created all of the literature, literature citation, and patent citation (bibliometric) indicators used in the National Science Board’s biennial Science and Technology Indicators reports, from the first Science Indicators 1972 report through the Science and Engineering Indicators 2012 report. In the early 1980s, CHI extended the bibliometric analysis of literature citations to patent citation analysis and pioneered the application of bibliometric techniques to corporate technology evaluation. In the late 1980s, CHI developed the first patent-to-paper citation database and went on to prove the rapidly growing links between science and technology. In the 1990s, CHI extended this line of analysis to the economic realm, and obtained two patents that delineate the relationship between patent citations and company stock market performance. Narin’s most highly cited paper is “The Increasing Linkage between U.S. Technology and Public Science” from 1997, which showed that 73 percent of the science then cited in U.S. industry patents had originated in the public sector. Numerous congressional and other policy documents have since then cited that finding, and The New York Times reviewed the paper in “Study Finds Public
Science Is Pillar of Industry.” In 1988, Narin was awarded the Derek de Solla Price Medal for his outstanding contributions to quantitative studies of science.",Narin,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cns-iu/scimaps/gh-pages/assets/content/person/francis-narin/image.jpg,,,,['maker'],,,"Chicago, IL, USA",,,,,,,

Abstract: 

Mapping the New Politics of Care displayed the effects of COVID-19 in the United States layering a wide range of social, economic, and environmental conditions on two interactive maps utilizing multiple vulnerability indexes. 

The first map, titled Community Health Workers, asked viewers to imagine what would happen if one million community workers were allocated across the USA by comparing four indexes of vulnerability alongside COVID-19 data. A user can toggle between multiple vulnerabilities for the distribution of the workers, specific to each county. Making decisions like this responsibly requires confronting and addressing not just the virus but also the inequalities and vulnerabilities that propelled the pandemic.

All people in the USA were granted the right to have access to free, safe, and effective COVID-19 vaccines over multiple federal distribution phases. But due to the limited doses available, the majority of states followed the Center for Disease Control’s recommendations to prioritize health-care personnel and long-term care facility residents in receiving the first vaccines. 

The second map titled, Vaccine Allocation, focused on this first distribution, Phase 1A of the federal program and compared how each state could have distributed 22 million doses of vaccine more equitably. Users can compare Phase 1A allocation vs allocation to vulnerable populations county by county, in each state. Prioritizing vulnerability could have mitigated health inequities and protected communities that were more likely to have the first and most concentrated COVID-19 outbreaks.

The vulnerabilities made visible in both maps predated the pandemic and created the conditions for the virus to flourish. Both maps display the acute inequalities embedded in the social and political landscape of the USA. This pandemic is not simply biological. It is a symptom of an illness in our body politic. As COVID-19 roared across the country, it followed the fault lines of social vulnerability.","Gonsalves, Gregg, and Amy Kapczynski. 2020. “The New Politics of Care.” Boston Review, April 26, 2020. http://bostonreview.net/politics/gregg-gonsalves-amy-kapczynski-new-politics-care.

This project explores the relationship between the capitalist system and its implications for climate change. Rooted in a critical examination of the capitalist pursuit of profit, perpetual consumption patterns, and the resulting inequality between citizens of “developed” and “developing” economies, it highlights the profound impact of these factors on the escalating climate crisis. Driven by H.A Baer’s work which emphasizes the role of capitalist ideology in perpetuating reliance on fossil fuels and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions \[1], we leverage data from the World Bank on greenhouse gas emissions per capita \[2], and the Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index (CRI) \[3]. The CRI is a weighted index of 4 measures used to evaluate the losses a country has experienced from extreme weather events connected to climate change. The losses analyzed are economic losses (absolute losses of purchasing power parity, and losses per GDP unit), and loss of life (number of lives lost, and deaths per 100,000 inhabitants). 

The visualization was created in processing using particle systems and a physics library to simulate realistic hurricane behavior. Particles leave short trails and have a centrifugal motion: rotating closer to the center than in the outer rim. The hurricanes have different eye sizes, total sizes, and speeds based on data values. For very at-risk countries, you would see a large hurricane with a small eye rotating quickly. The particles extinguish when they reach the eye of the hurricane and are then reseeded in the periphery. Ultimately, we aim to visually represent climate vulnerabilities juxtaposed with global greenhouse gas emissions to shed light on the relationship between risk and emissions at the country-level granularity. We emphasize that for high emitting nations, while pollution has historical been something to bury or ship away, climate risk cannot be exported.

He studied ethnology and cultural anthropology at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe University (Frankfurt am Main) and art at the Düsseldorf Academy of Fine Arts, Germany. In the 1970s, his travels took him to Northern Africa, North and Central America, and Asia. Günther's early sculptural works with video led him toward more journalistic projects, which he pursued in TV, print, and art. Based in New York, he played a crucial role in the evaluation and interpretation of satellite data gathered from political and military crisis zones; the results were distributed internationally through print media and TV news. The goal was to make previously inaccessible military and ecological information available to the public in order to have a direct impact on political processes. Since 1988, Günther has used globes as a medium for his artistic and journalistic interests. In 1989, nine months before the unification of Germany, he founded the first independent TV station in Eastern Europe, Kanal X (Channel X), in Leipzig, in order to contribute to the establishment of a free media landscape. The interviews and research he conducted during a journey of several months through the Cambodian refugee camps in Thailand became the basis of a series of articles published in the German newspaper Die Tageszeitung (taz).

Abstract:

User group: This piece is for the science-interested public, students, and educators

Data used: The macroscope is based on a research paper published in Science. The paper uses digitized photographs of eggs from 1400 bird species to show what factors are important in determining the shape of bird eggs. https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaj1945

Data analysis: The researchers measured the eggs in the photos and used different approaches to determine how different egg shapes are formed in a bird and also which egg shapes correlate with other characteristics of a bird species, such as wing type.

Viz techniques applied: 

Packed circle diagram to show how many eggs, bird species, and orders were included in the data 

Graph to show how bird egg shapes were characterized in the study

Egg photographs used as data in the paper

Animations of how different factors might influence egg shape  

Graphs showing the relationship between egg shape and flight style 

Main insights gained: CRACKING THE MYSTERY OF EGG SHAPE follows researchers’ efforts to solve a long-standing mystery in biology: Why are eggs shaped differently from species to species? The work visualizes results from the analysis of a data set of 1400 species’ eggs, cataloged in a repository of egg photographs collected over the course of 100 years. The site exposes viewers to the diversity of birds, egg shapes, and the mechanisms by which eggs are formed. It also demonstrates how science can use data from historical sources in new ways.",https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaj1945 Egg collection at Museum of Vertebrate Zoology https://mvz.berkeley.edu/mvzegg/,sarah-crespi/readme; jia-you/readme

Abstract: 

Mapping the New Politics of Care displayed the effects of COVID-19 in the United States layering a wide range of social, economic, and environmental conditions on two interactive maps utilizing multiple vulnerability indexes. 

The first map, titled Community Health Workers, asked viewers to imagine what would happen if one million community workers were allocated across the USA by comparing four indexes of vulnerability alongside COVID-19 data. A user can toggle between multiple vulnerabilities for the distribution of the workers, specific to each county. Making decisions like this responsibly requires confronting and addressing not just the virus but also the inequalities and vulnerabilities that propelled the pandemic.

All people in the USA were granted the right to have access to free, safe, and effective COVID-19 vaccines over multiple federal distribution phases. But due to the limited doses available, the majority of states followed the Center for Disease Control’s recommendations to prioritize health-care personnel and long-term care facility residents in receiving the first vaccines. 

The second map titled, Vaccine Allocation, focused on this first distribution, Phase 1A of the federal program and compared how each state could have distributed 22 million doses of vaccine more equitably. Users can compare Phase 1A allocation vs allocation to vulnerable populations county by county, in each state. Prioritizing vulnerability could have mitigated health inequities and protected communities that were more likely to have the first and most concentrated COVID-19 outbreaks.

The vulnerabilities made visible in both maps predated the pandemic and created the conditions for the virus to flourish. Both maps display the acute inequalities embedded in the social and political landscape of the USA. This pandemic is not simply biological. It is a symptom of an illness in our body politic. As COVID-19 roared across the country, it followed the fault lines of social vulnerability.","Gonsalves, Gregg, and Amy Kapczynski. 2020. “The New Politics of Care.” Boston Review, April 26, 2020. http://bostonreview.net/politics/gregg-gonsalves-amy-kapczynski-new-politics-care.

Abstract: 

We propose a general toolbox for the Now.museum - a ""digital space"" dedicated to individual and collective memories of significant events in our societies - whose context is informed by the collection and conservation of artifacts publicly available on the web. 
Clearly, Covid-19 and its global spreading belong to these significant events and could be documented by sharing digital collections across specific societal sectors, scientific domains, etc. However, a question is “how to capture its double spreading dimensionality spatially and in time”? Even if several retrospective initiatives exist, an integrative data curation approach and interface on information and testimonies is still missing. Moreover, relatively little attention was given to the ‘voices’ of the public, their testimonies, experiences, losses, and aspirations. 
Following the Open Science principle for science democratization, our macroscope – with its timeline interface -  answers these concerns with open data which provides context to individual experiences. Its infrastructural backbone consists in an open source archival platform (Dataverse) nourished from the capture of public parts of newspaper and social media, published in all Europe and in all languages since December 2019, including the term “Covid” in their title. 
The interface is designed as a searchable timeline, where captures are displayed as thumbnails, and sources as well as topics are color coded. The captures are indexed using AI techniques and links are provided to the original contents. The interactive interface is accompanied by a number of static overview maps, tracing bursts and changes in terminology, paying attention to geographic spread and multilinguality. 
The general design of the Now.museum as a space of cultural heritage, is applicable for any memory-collecting and sharing activity among the wider public, hence individual contributions are expected. To this end, a workflow is designed and a first implementation of ‘citizen/crowd material’ is given.

PS: Domain names Now.museum and Covid-19.museum are the ownership of Yves Rozenholc since the beginning of April 2020. Their denominations have been validated by the ICOM (International Council of Museums) which controls the extension museum.","A github repository  https://github.com/C19M/Covid-19.Museum describes the case, and contains links to the software code used. The timeline in essence runs on a Dataverse instance.

Abstract: 

Mapping the New Politics of Care displayed the effects of COVID-19 in the United States layering a wide range of social, economic, and environmental conditions on two interactive maps utilizing multiple vulnerability indexes. 

The first map, titled Community Health Workers, asked viewers to imagine what would happen if one million community workers were allocated across the USA by comparing four indexes of vulnerability alongside COVID-19 data. A user can toggle between multiple vulnerabilities for the distribution of the workers, specific to each county. Making decisions like this responsibly requires confronting and addressing not just the virus but also the inequalities and vulnerabilities that propelled the pandemic.

All people in the USA were granted the right to have access to free, safe, and effective COVID-19 vaccines over multiple federal distribution phases. But due to the limited doses available, the majority of states followed the Center for Disease Control’s recommendations to prioritize health-care personnel and long-term care facility residents in receiving the first vaccines. 

The second map titled, Vaccine Allocation, focused on this first distribution, Phase 1A of the federal program and compared how each state could have distributed 22 million doses of vaccine more equitably. Users can compare Phase 1A allocation vs allocation to vulnerable populations county by county, in each state. Prioritizing vulnerability could have mitigated health inequities and protected communities that were more likely to have the first and most concentrated COVID-19 outbreaks.

The vulnerabilities made visible in both maps predated the pandemic and created the conditions for the virus to flourish. Both maps display the acute inequalities embedded in the social and political landscape of the USA. This pandemic is not simply biological. It is a symptom of an illness in our body politic. As COVID-19 roared across the country, it followed the fault lines of social vulnerability.","Gonsalves, Gregg, and Amy Kapczynski. 2020. “The New Politics of Care.” Boston Review, April 26, 2020. http://bostonreview.net/politics/gregg-gonsalves-amy-kapczynski-new-politics-care.

GeneticFlow, our Macroscope, is intricately designed for the academic user groups at large, e.g., researchers, educators, decision-makers, or even fresh students in universities and research institutions. The tool meets an important need of academic researchers on the in-depth analysis and interpretation of scholars' impact, streamlining tasks such as scientific career analysis, academic award selection, and tenure evaluation. For junior students, it also opens a door for visually understanding the career path and biography of prestigious scientists, e.g., Turing award winners and Nobel prize laureates. Now we focus on several areas inside the computer science discipline, including AI, database, graphics, visualization, etc., but we may extend the coverage to more disciplines in near future (e.g., physics, material). 

The GeneticFlow tool mainly utilizes the comprehensive dataset provided by Microsoft Academic Graph, which encompasses an almost full coverage of academic data including papers, authors, citations, and topics, till 2021.10. At its core, the GeneticFlow tool designed a self-citation graph to visualize the evolution of a scholar’s research innovations, as well as their external impact. Cutting edge algorithms, including advisor-advisee detection, extend-type citation classification, embedding-based topic generation, and graph neural networks are employed in our tool for both effective visualization and downstream inference tasks. More details can be found in our KDD 2023, VIS 2023, and NeuroIPS 2023 papers. 

The visualization design employs a time-dependent hierarchical graph representation, further augmented with appropriate color mapping, interactive trend charts, and a topical map view, providing multidimensional insights into temporal and thematic aspects of a scholar's research contribution and impact. Through extensive case studies and quantitative evaluations, we find that the GeneticFlow visualization can highlight the key success of top-ranked scholars. It also predicts high-level award recipients (e.g., ACM fellows), with significantly better performance than classical impact indicators such as h-index, i-10 index, and citation networks.

Macroscope Link: <http://www.go4trees.com/four-seasons/>

This interactive dashboard, created for the World Government Summit, aims to visualize the world's development indicators. The visualization presents different seasons, emphasizing various aspects. 

Spring is a time of growth and development. 

Summer is a time of prosperity, yet a few countries face economic hardship. Economic prosperity can also be seen as a sign of success and abundance. However, only some have equal access to these resources, and inequalities can arise when some people have more access to wealth, opportunities, and resources than others. 

Fall is a time of change, as the leaves change color and fall to the ground. It is also a sign of the bounty for fruits.

Winter is a time of preparation for crisis. Addressing the energy and climate crisis may require a collective effort to prepare for the challenges ahead. Snow here is a symbol of the challenges and difficulties that we face as a society. 

In each season, it presents a tree that tells a performance story by visualizing the performance metrics of each sub-region and country. The tree roots present the global performances over the past ten years. The past provides the foundation for the present and future, just like the roots of a tree. 

The sunlight and rain in the sky visualize the buzz of 20 development and 18 innovation frontiers from seven categories. Just as the future holds the potential for growth and development, development and innovation are like the sunlight and rain that provide energy and water for a tree to grow and flourish.

Abstract: 

In over five years, we have published several releases of the www.excellencemapping.net tool revealing (clusters of) excellent institutions worldwide based on citation data. With the new release, a completely revised tool has been published. It is not only based on citation data (bibliometrics) but also Mendeley data (altmetrics). Thus, the institutional impact measurement of the tool has been expanded by focusing on additional status groups besides researchers, such as students and librarians. The excellencemapping.net is the first university ranking that includes altmetrics data to visualize the impact of institutional research beyond research itself. For example, the new release facilitates that those institutions worldwide can be identified with the highest impact of research on students. In the new release, the visualization of the data has been completely updated by improving the operability for the user and including new features, such as institutional profile pages.","Recent paper introducing the new release of excellencemapping.net: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04141-4

Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has steadily become more powerful over the course of the last decades and in recent years it has entered our world in many different domains. In a companion article – the brief history of artificial intelligence – I document this development. 

This was achieved despite having relatively few resources. Until recently, investments in terms of capital and scientific efforts were small. In this article I highlight that this has very much changed in recent years. Corporate investment has increased and the scientific field has grown in size. Given how rapidly AI developed in the past, despite the limited resources, this should make us expect AI technology to continue to become more powerful in the coming decades.

With the new release, a completely revised tool has been published. It is not only based on citation data (bibliometrics) but also Mendeley data (altmetrics). Thus, the institutional impact measurement of the tool has been expanded by focusing on additional status groups besides researchers, such as students and librarians. The excellencemapping.net is the first university ranking that includes altmetrics data to visualize the impact of institutional research beyond research itself. For example, the new release facilitates that those institutions worldwide can be identified with the highest impact of research on students.

Measuring human development helps us understand how people’s lives and livelihoods vary across the world and how they have changed over time. 

There are several prominent measures that try to capture these changes: 

* The Human Development Index (HDI) 
* The Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI) 
* The Gender Development Index (GDI) 
* The Augmented Human Development Index (AHDI) 

The first three are published by the United Nations Development Programme. The AHDI, meanwhile, was developed by the economic historian Leandro Prados de la Escosura. 

All these measures seek to broaden the scope of development beyond simple economic growth and to capture other key metrics that track peoples’ living standards. 

However, measuring human development comes with many challenges. People do not always agree on what should be included. And even once defined, features of human development are difficult to measure. So how do these indices track human development? And what can we learn from them? We summarize the similarities and differences between the different approaches in this article and how to decide on which one to use.

This project celebrates multi-racial families in the United States from 1860 to 2020, highlighting the gradual dissolution of systemic barriers against racial intermingling in households. Historically, homogenous communities were prevalent, with multi-racial families being rare. Census data before 1960 showed only traces of such families, as race was categorized by enumerators. Post-1970, household members reported their race, marking a shift in racial identification. 

Key legal milestones include the 1967 Loving v. Virginia ruling, which lifted restrictions on multi-racial marriages, and the 2015 Obergefell v. Hodges decision, legalizing same-sex marriages. It wasn't until after 2000 that individuals could officially identify as multi-racial. 

The visualization presents each multi-racial couple as a colorful chromosome, detailing the races, ages, sexes, and children of each family. Couples are organized by rarity, age, and number of children, highlighting the evolving structure of American families. Same-sex couples are included in recent years' data, along with a special notation for Latino/as. 

The tool uses two canvas elements for visualization: one displays all families for a selected year, and the other offers a zoomed-in view based on mouse position. An efficient hashing system links mouse coordinates to family data, reducing computational load. Chromosomes are artistically rendered using p5.js with Rom-Catmull splines, and motion is simulated through Perlin noise function. Ages are represented by varying heights, using a square root scale for better visual consistency. 

Data for this project comes from the anonymized micro-census of the IPUMS USA database, processed through MongoDB to parse households, identify multi-racial families, and structure them as hierarchical JSON objects. This innovative approach not only provides a vivid representation of America's racial diversity but also serves as a testament to the country's evolving societal norms and legal frameworks concerning race and relationships.

Abstract: 

The Social Determinants of Health Visualization Tool is an R Shiny application that provides a user-friendly platform for public health researchers, policy makers and the public to examine spatial-temporal patterns of and relationships between social determinants of health (SDOH) measures known to influence health outcomes at multi-scales in the U.S.

This visualization tool uses the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) SDOH beta database, which was curated from multiple Federal and publicly available data sources. Measures in the AHRQ SDOH database correspond to five key SDOH domains: social context (e.g., age, race/ethnicity), economic context (e.g., income, poverty), education, physical infrastructure (e.g., crime, environment), and healthcare context (e.g., health access, quality, behaviors). SDOH measures were collected for multiple years at two geographic levels in the U.S., i.e., county (324 variables, from 2009 to 2018), ZCTA (159 variables, from 2011 to 2018).

Using maps created by the Mapbox GL JavaScript library, and associated scatterplots, summary tables, and graphs created by R Shiny, this tool can display a wide range of SDOH measures at scale. There are three key elements of the tool: 

•        The Interactive Map tab renders county and ZCTA-level maps with options to select year and search for specific SDOH measure sorted by SDOH domain and topic. The zoom-in function allows for quick examination of SDOH in individual state and county.

•        The Change Analysis tab provides side by side synchronized maps, a scatterplot with Pearson correlation test, a multi-group histogram and a summary table, allowing users to investigate temporal changes of a SDOH measure.

•        The Pattern Comparisons tab further enables users to identify spatial associations and statistical relationships between different SDOH measures. 

With these features, this visualization tool can be used to obtain critical insights into the spatial-temporal patterns in and associations between SDOH measures, thereby informing public health research and practice.",<https://www.ahrq.gov/sdoh/data-analytics/sdoh-data.html>,peter-herman/readme; chang-zhao/readme

Abstract:  

""Spain lives in flats"" is an innovative and interactive journalistic project by elDiario.es that analyzes the footprint of more than 12 million buildings to map the height of Spanish cities in 3D to analyze their sustainability and impact on the current urban society. The investigation that includes narrative visualizations shows why Spain is one of the countries in the world that has built the highest and most dense cities compared to other countries. Two of every three Spaniards live in flats and apartments and only a third in single-family and semi-detached houses.

We created an R script that downloaded cadastral data and footprints of more than 12 million buildings. The total size of the downloaded files exceeded 200GB.

Then, we processed and joined in R all downloaded files to have a single database with the details of all the buildings in Spain. For example, we verified the data of 12 million buildings, we calculated the height of every building from the part that occupies the most built volume in the plans and we extracted the date of the building from the start of construction. All these processes were repeated several times during the year due to the publication of corrections and allowed us for the first time in Spain to have a database and a map with the heights of all the buildings in the country. This project compiled for the first time in a single database the cartographic plans of all the buildings currently standing in the Spanish territory and proved that in Spain we live in tall buildings.

When considering the structure of the story, we conceived it as a journey from the small anecdote to the big phenomenon. For this reason, the piece begins by telling the story of a building in A Coruña and then explaining vertical urbanism in Spain. This story works as a historical journey through each urban model developed in Spain contextualized with graphics and details of each moment.
 
We used R, Rstudio, QGIS and Tippecanoe for data compilation, processing and analysis. We had to do a lot of tests to compress the geographic information as much as possible to be able to map it on all devices. D3.js and Javascript were used for data visualization.

Can we estimate how much the world has changed in a decade? Or do our own experiences impact the perception of progress? The work, titled The Shape of Change, challenges our assumptions about how key statistical indicators regarding Health, the Environment, or Education evolve through the years. The work was done in the context of the World Data Visualization Prize, part of the World Government Summit 2023. For that year, the competition focused on the past, present, and future of society and governments. The goal was to create a tool to showcase how data visualization can show data on innovations, decisions, and metrics that can be used to drive and measure progress. The organization made available three datasets, from which participants should create the visualizations. The dataset used in this work contained yearly observations for statistical indicators between 2012 and 2022. The work is a scrolly-telling piece that starts by taking the reader through significant news stories of the past decade. The goal is to connect the reader to the indicators by remembering specific events. Then, they are prompted to guess how an indicator related to the event changed, challenging the perception of the immediacy of news stories with the continuous change during the decade. Additionally, it has been shown \[1] that users prompted to reflect on their prior knowledge by predicting and self-explaining improve their recall and comprehension of the data. These exercises also serve to introduce the user to the visual element used to represent change: the angle, direction, and color of the triangles. This knowledge is then needed to interpret the small multiples visualization at the end of the piece, where the reader can have a bird's-eye view of the yearly change for all the indicators.

Abstract: 

In over five years, we have published several releases of the www.excellencemapping.net tool revealing (clusters of) excellent institutions worldwide based on citation data. With the new release, a completely revised tool has been published. It is not only based on citation data (bibliometrics) but also Mendeley data (altmetrics). Thus, the institutional impact measurement of the tool has been expanded by focusing on additional status groups besides researchers, such as students and librarians. The excellencemapping.net is the first university ranking that includes altmetrics data to visualize the impact of institutional research beyond research itself. For example, the new release facilitates that those institutions worldwide can be identified with the highest impact of research on students. In the new release, the visualization of the data has been completely updated by improving the operability for the user and including new features, such as institutional profile pages.","Recent paper introducing the new release of excellencemapping.net: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-021-04141-4

The river runner tool helps people to better understand the interconnectedness of our watersheds by calculating the downstream path from anywhere on earth and visualizing the journey. 

In its original iteration, it relied on the USGS's NLDI, which links water features and flowpaths within the United States. The dataset compiled for the global version created in collaboration with hydrologists at the USGS and the Internet of Water, though it remains a work in progress (particularly with regards to its coverage of water feature names). 

The frontend for the visualization was built with svelte and mapbox, putting the user in control of a 3D journey from a place of their choosing to an ocean or inland lake. The aim was to zoom in with an immersive flyover experience to give a sense of how many places and communities are downstream of one another. I also wanted to provide navigation widgets in the corners to orient someone in the full network of streams, tributaries, and rivers it takes to reach an ocean or endhoric basin.

Link to Macroscope: <https://vis.sciencemag.org/eggs/>  or <https://visdev.sciencemag.org/eggs/>  

Abstract:

User group: This piece is for the science-interested public, students, and educators

Data used: The macroscope is based on a research paper published in Science. The paper uses digitized photographs of eggs from 1400 bird species to show what factors are important in determining the shape of bird eggs. https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaj1945

Data analysis: The researchers measured the eggs in the photos and used different approaches to determine how different egg shapes are formed in a bird and also which egg shapes correlate with other characteristics of a bird species, such as wing type.

Viz techniques applied: 

Packed circle diagram to show how many eggs, bird species, and orders were included in the data 

Graph to show how bird egg shapes were characterized in the study

Egg photographs used as data in the paper

Animations of how different factors might influence egg shape  

Graphs showing the relationship between egg shape and flight style 

Main insights gained: CRACKING THE MYSTERY OF EGG SHAPE follows researchers’ efforts to solve a long-standing mystery in biology: Why are eggs shaped differently from species to species? The work visualizes results from the analysis of a data set of 1400 species’ eggs, cataloged in a repository of egg photographs collected over the course of 100 years. The site exposes viewers to the diversity of birds, egg shapes, and the mechanisms by which eggs are formed. It also demonstrates how science can use data from historical sources in new ways.",https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaj1945 Egg collection at Museum of Vertebrate Zoology https://mvz.berkeley.edu/mvzegg/,sarah-crespi/readme; jia-you/readme

Abstract: 

Mapping the New Politics of Care displayed the effects of COVID-19 in the United States layering a wide range of social, economic, and environmental conditions on two interactive maps utilizing multiple vulnerability indexes. 

The first map, titled Community Health Workers, asked viewers to imagine what would happen if one million community workers were allocated across the USA by comparing four indexes of vulnerability alongside COVID-19 data. A user can toggle between multiple vulnerabilities for the distribution of the workers, specific to each county. Making decisions like this responsibly requires confronting and addressing not just the virus but also the inequalities and vulnerabilities that propelled the pandemic.

All people in the USA were granted the right to have access to free, safe, and effective COVID-19 vaccines over multiple federal distribution phases. But due to the limited doses available, the majority of states followed the Center for Disease Control’s recommendations to prioritize health-care personnel and long-term care facility residents in receiving the first vaccines. 

The second map titled, Vaccine Allocation, focused on this first distribution, Phase 1A of the federal program and compared how each state could have distributed 22 million doses of vaccine more equitably. Users can compare Phase 1A allocation vs allocation to vulnerable populations county by county, in each state. Prioritizing vulnerability could have mitigated health inequities and protected communities that were more likely to have the first and most concentrated COVID-19 outbreaks.

The vulnerabilities made visible in both maps predated the pandemic and created the conditions for the virus to flourish. Both maps display the acute inequalities embedded in the social and political landscape of the USA. This pandemic is not simply biological. It is a symptom of an illness in our body politic. As COVID-19 roared across the country, it followed the fault lines of social vulnerability.","Gonsalves, Gregg, and Amy Kapczynski. 2020. “The New Politics of Care.” Boston Review, April 26, 2020. http://bostonreview.net/politics/gregg-gonsalves-amy-kapczynski-new-politics-care.

Abstract: 

We propose a general toolbox for the Now.museum - a ""digital space"" dedicated to individual and collective memories of significant events in our societies - whose context is informed by the collection and conservation of artifacts publicly available on the web. 
Clearly, Covid-19 and its global spreading belong to these significant events and could be documented by sharing digital collections across specific societal sectors, scientific domains, etc. However, a question is “how to capture its double spreading dimensionality spatially and in time”? Even if several retrospective initiatives exist, an integrative data curation approach and interface on information and testimonies is still missing. Moreover, relatively little attention was given to the ‘voices’ of the public, their testimonies, experiences, losses, and aspirations. 
Following the Open Science principle for science democratization, our macroscope – with its timeline interface -  answers these concerns with open data which provides context to individual experiences. Its infrastructural backbone consists in an open source archival platform (Dataverse) nourished from the capture of public parts of newspaper and social media, published in all Europe and in all languages since December 2019, including the term “Covid” in their title. 
The interface is designed as a searchable timeline, where captures are displayed as thumbnails, and sources as well as topics are color coded. The captures are indexed using AI techniques and links are provided to the original contents. The interactive interface is accompanied by a number of static overview maps, tracing bursts and changes in terminology, paying attention to geographic spread and multilinguality. 
The general design of the Now.museum as a space of cultural heritage, is applicable for any memory-collecting and sharing activity among the wider public, hence individual contributions are expected. To this end, a workflow is designed and a first implementation of ‘citizen/crowd material’ is given.

PS: Domain names Now.museum and Covid-19.museum are the ownership of Yves Rozenholc since the beginning of April 2020. Their denominations have been validated by the ICOM (International Council of Museums) which controls the extension museum.","A github repository  https://github.com/C19M/Covid-19.Museum describes the case, and contains links to the software code used. The timeline in essence runs on a Dataverse instance.

W. Bradford Paley,"W. Bradford Paley uses computers to create visual displays with the goal of making readable, clear, and engaging expressions of complex data. His visual representations are inspired by the calm, richly layered information in natural scenes. He applies rendering methods used by fine artists and graphic artists, informed by their possible underpinnings in human perception, and uses them to create narrowly scoped, almost idiosyncratic representations whose visual semantics are often driven by the real-world metaphors of the experts who know the domains best. Paley rendered his first computer graphics in 1973; graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1981; founded Digital Image Design Incorporated in 1982; and started creating financial and statistical data visualization in 1986. He has exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, is in the Artport permanent collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art, and has received multiple grants and awards for both art and design. He recently finished redesigning the interface at the center of the New York Stock Exchange trading floor. He is an adjunct associate professor at Columbia University and is director of Information Esthetics, an interdisciplinary group exploring the creation and interpretation of data representations that are both readable and aesthetically satisfying.",Paley,https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cns-iu/scimaps/gh-pages/assets/content/person/w-bradford-paley/image.jpg,,,,['maker'],,,"New York, NY, USA",,,,,,,

GeneticFlow, our Macroscope, is intricately designed for the academic user groups at large, e.g., researchers, educators, decision-makers, or even fresh students in universities and research institutions. The tool meets an important need of academic researchers on the in-depth analysis and interpretation of scholars' impact, streamlining tasks such as scientific career analysis, academic award selection, and tenure evaluation. For junior students, it also opens a door for visually understanding the career path and biography of prestigious scientists, e.g., Turing award winners and Nobel prize laureates. Now we focus on several areas inside the computer science discipline, including AI, database, graphics, visualization, etc., but we may extend the coverage to more disciplines in near future (e.g., physics, material). 

The GeneticFlow tool mainly utilizes the comprehensive dataset provided by Microsoft Academic Graph, which encompasses an almost full coverage of academic data including papers, authors, citations, and topics, till 2021.10. At its core, the GeneticFlow tool designed a self-citation graph to visualize the evolution of a scholar’s research innovations, as well as their external impact. Cutting edge algorithms, including advisor-advisee detection, extend-type citation classification, embedding-based topic generation, and graph neural networks are employed in our tool for both effective visualization and downstream inference tasks. More details can be found in our KDD 2023, VIS 2023, and NeuroIPS 2023 papers. 

The visualization design employs a time-dependent hierarchical graph representation, further augmented with appropriate color mapping, interactive trend charts, and a topical map view, providing multidimensional insights into temporal and thematic aspects of a scholar's research contribution and impact. Through extensive case studies and quantitative evaluations, we find that the GeneticFlow visualization can highlight the key success of top-ranked scholars. It also predicts high-level award recipients (e.g., ACM fellows), with significantly better performance than classical impact indicators such as h-index, i-10 index, and citation networks.

Abstract:
This interactive article presents a so-called “explorable explainer” of the k-means clustering algorithm. It attempts to push the envelope of how visual explanations can be designed on an interactive computational medium such as the web.

This article explains the algorithm using a “scrollytelling” piece. As the reader scrolls through the article, not only do the visuals animate and transition accordingly with the text, the reader is also prompted to interact with these geometric visualizations of the algorithm, supplementing their intuition through hands-on experimentation with its inner workings.

As the article progresses and introduces more concepts, it also slowly introduces corresponding knobs and dials that the reader can play around with. The article finally concludes with a dashboard or sandbox that comprises all the interactive controls that came before, giving the reader free rein to probe around and dissect the algorithm to improve their own understanding of its details as they please.

Abstract: Is Food Making You Sick? is exploring the relationship between diet and health in 184 countries through the analysis and visualization of extensive data on nutritional factors and diseases. The project aims to study and visualize these relationships by juxtaposing 47 nutrients and 84 health conditions, allowing users to explore and analyze almost four thousand unique relationships. By exploring the patterns between food consumption and health outcomes, users could better inform their dietary choices and be empowered by high quality, research data. Exposing the data visually could also spark discussion amongst researchers, setting the stage for testing hypotheses and performing additional studies, challenging the knowledge we currently have. 

The tool utilizes over 6 GB of data from the Global Dietary Database and the Global Burden of Disease. The data were cleaned, synchronized, and meaningful relationships were selected to be displayed in the final work. Visualizing these correlations in a highly customizable, interactive scatterplot, empowers users to explore relationships, analyze, and interpret complex data in a single, multilayered visualization. The powerful filtering options allow users to increase or decrease the complexity by adding or removing layers of information, utilizing color-coding or sizing of the circles representing each country to convey their geographic location or display additional metrics, such as population, obesity or underweight rates. This empowers users to customize their experience to reflect their analytical needs. Analysis is further supported by the ability to plot a regression line, indicating the direction and strength of each relationship. 

Visualizing close to 4,000 unique relationships, the tool allows users to explore and analyze large amounts of data in a highly analytical way - an important starting point in learning more about what are the ways in which the food we consume may influence our health.

Abstract: 

We propose a general toolbox for the Now.museum - a ""digital space"" dedicated to individual and collective memories of significant events in our societies - whose context is informed by the collection and conservation of artifacts publicly available on the web. 
Clearly, Covid-19 and its global spreading belong to these significant events and could be documented by sharing digital collections across specific societal sectors, scientific domains, etc. However, a question is “how to capture its double spreading dimensionality spatially and in time”? Even if several retrospective initiatives exist, an integrative data curation approach and interface on information and testimonies is still missing. Moreover, relatively little attention was given to the ‘voices’ of the public, their testimonies, experiences, losses, and aspirations. 
Following the Open Science principle for science democratization, our macroscope – with its timeline interface -  answers these concerns with open data which provides context to individual experiences. Its infrastructural backbone consists in an open source archival platform (Dataverse) nourished from the capture of public parts of newspaper and social media, published in all Europe and in all languages since December 2019, including the term “Covid” in their title. 
The interface is designed as a searchable timeline, where captures are displayed as thumbnails, and sources as well as topics are color coded. The captures are indexed using AI techniques and links are provided to the original contents. The interactive interface is accompanied by a number of static overview maps, tracing bursts and changes in terminology, paying attention to geographic spread and multilinguality. 
The general design of the Now.museum as a space of cultural heritage, is applicable for any memory-collecting and sharing activity among the wider public, hence individual contributions are expected. To this end, a workflow is designed and a first implementation of ‘citizen/crowd material’ is given.

PS: Domain names Now.museum and Covid-19.museum are the ownership of Yves Rozenholc since the beginning of April 2020. Their denominations have been validated by the ICOM (International Council of Museums) which controls the extension museum.","A github repository  https://github.com/C19M/Covid-19.Museum describes the case, and contains links to the software code used. The timeline in essence runs on a Dataverse instance.
